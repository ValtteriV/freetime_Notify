## Progress
- Set up the GitHub repository.
- Took the sandbox and started reformatting it into a proper program structure.
- Started writing the GUI using TKinter.

## TODO:
- There seems to be an issue where the Notifier is not pushing any notifications or logging its progress. This might have to do with TKinter having its own event loop.
- Figure out how to track global keypresses and if TKinter can 'hide' a window or if the window has to be destroyed and recreated each time.
