## freetime_Notify
Notification application that allows you to set multiple reminders that use the windows toasts for notifying you.

# Purpose of the application
The purpose of this application is to be able to set notifications through a pop-up window that can be invoked through a set key combination.These notifications will display a Windows Toast after the set time has elapsed.

# Purpose of the project
This idea came to me through the need for multiple notifications in a short span of time and my laziness to lift my arms off my keyboard and mouse to use my phone for them. Before this project I had been interested in learning about how the windows pop-up notifications worked as well as getting to apply threading to a project in a meaningful way. As the concept of the project was further developed in my head I identified the challenge of tracking global keypresses and the concern for potential performance impact on other applications for this behaviour. However, for the time being, I aim to get this project to a working state before concerning myself with the performance although I will acknowledge that it may be best to rewrite this program in another, more efficient language.
